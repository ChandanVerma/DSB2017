# Data Science Bowl 2017 Solution (No Transfer learning)
This repo explains us how to build a Convolutional neural network in Tensorflow for Medical Imaging.
The Solution is for Kaggle competition Data Science Bowl 2017.

# Problem statement : Build an Algorithm that accuratelu classifies a given CT scan into cancerous or not.

The code files are provided in the above section:

Files must be executed in the following order:

1. Preprocessing.py
2. data_resize.py
3. data_split.py
4. data_stacking.py
5. label_stack.py
6. Tensorflow_CNN.py

It is expected that all the required libraries must be installed namely Tensorflow, skimage etc.
All  the codes are written in python.
